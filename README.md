# Basic Component Library

A very basic framework for building components.

Consider this more of a low level teaching tool for:
  - using classes in web development
  - understanding how UI frameworks like React or Angular work


## Setup

Install dev environment (Webpack) dependencies

`> npm i`

Run Webpack

`> webpack --watch`
